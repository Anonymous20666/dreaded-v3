## FEATURES

*** This is a semi-complex WhatsApp bot which is a modification of the predecessor `dreaded-md` and `dreaded-v2` but with a database configuration and more commands. It has group management features, some media commands, image manipulation commands as well as AI and many other features incorporated.


 *** Some AI and media commands use our API. This API is not very reliable hence sometimes there may be a downtime.***
